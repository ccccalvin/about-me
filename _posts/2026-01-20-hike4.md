*squad*:
- Josiah
- Peter

*thoughts*:
- certain parts of the track were quite muddy, due to rain over the past couple days. good to test out the gore-tex on my Merrell's tho
- nice "summit" location where we had lunch, located off the track
- Josiah nearly had no lunch (his lighter wouldn't ignite), but by God's grace it ignited 🙏
- waterfall spot was super nice in person, the photos don't do it justice
- forgot to wear sunscreen, so my nose and forehead got sunburnt...
- the meal after the hike was YUM; most delicious subway of my life.
